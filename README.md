## Criteria
- **Project is Star Wars themed**
- The website is centred around the antagonist of the original Star Wars trilogy: Darth Vader. 

- **Well-executed project with effective planning using GitHub Projects and a basic README.md** 
- Agile methodology was used by appointing a Scrum Master (Micah) and utilising a Kanban board on GitHub in order to prioritise and organise tasks. 

- **The project uses Star Wars sound effects**
- Sound effects are employed throughout the site when buttons are pressed.

- **Project demonstrates responsiveness, accessibility, and thorough testing**
- Project was designed with a mobile first approach. BootStrap was utilised to ensure responsiveness across all screen sizes. 
- The site was continually manually tested by members throughout development.

- **Fun and entertaining presentation**
- A video presentation was created using OBS.

## Design

- ![Hero image of Darth Vader](assets/images/darth_saber.jpeg)
- We focused our design around the character of Darth Vader. He wears a dark hooded cloak and carries a red lightsaber. The Star Wars universe also uses a distinctive font which we utilised on our site. Hover effects were used to create a light blurred effect around the edges of buttons on the site - to emulate a lightsaber. 

### Wireframes

### Colour scheme

- ![Colour palette - black, red, gunmetal]
- The colour scheme was chosen to match the costume of Darth Vader but also to provide enough contrast for accessibility reasons.

### Font

We chose to use [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik?preview.text=What%20colour%20is%20Darth%20Vader%27s%20light%20saber%3F&query=news) for the main text and [star wars]() font for headings.

### User experience


## Accessibility
- The colour scheme was run through a [Web Accessibility Colour Contrast Checker](https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/) to ensure good contrast for colours. 
- Aria labels were added so that users with screen readers can access the site more easily. 

## Responsiveness
- Bootstrap has been utilised through the site which provides great responsiveness on a range of devices. We have also used custom media queries where required (for example on the 404 page).
